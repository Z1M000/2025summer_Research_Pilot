## Summer Research 2025: Research Pilot

Research Pilot is a large-scale interactive system for researchers, designed for article recommendation and summarization.

During Summer 2025, I had the opportunity to explore data formats, Python tooling, and collaborative development. I am grateful for this experience and will continue contributing to the project in Fall 2025.

This repository documents the scripts of my main contributions:
- Task 5: LanceDB ingestion
- Task 10: Crossref incremental updates
- Task 11: Semantic Scholar reference list integration
