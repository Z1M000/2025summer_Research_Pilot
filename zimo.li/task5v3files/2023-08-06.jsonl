The surface area of jugular veins in humans is much smaller than in dogs and considerably longer grafts are needed. Moreover, the reproductive capacity of adult human endothelial cells under in vivo conditions, which probably determines the success of seeding more than the seeding density, is also uncertain. Therefore the efficiency of autologous endothelial seeding in humans was investigated in 18 patients undergoing distal femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The average surface area of the jugular veins was 4.9 +/- 1.7 cm2 with an average cell yield of 32.6 +/- 18.0 x 10(4). The mean number of seeded cells per square centimeter of graft surface was 3.1 x 10(3). In a follow-up extending for 14 weeks, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin as well as the platelet function in the whole blood aggregometer showed significantly better results in the seeded group. Plasma thromboxane B2, uptake and survival of indium 111-labeled platelets, and Doppler ultrasound investigations also favored the seeded group, but the results were statistically insignificant. No difference at all was found for the platelet dense granule compounds, releasable adenosine triphosphate and platelet serotonin. Thus our findings did not indicate the development of a closed endothelialized surface after 14 weeks, which is a period three times as long as the one required for confluent endothelial cell coverage in dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "ids": {"openalex": "https://openalex.org/W2103386241", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1067/mva.1987.avs0060535", "pmid": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3320387", "mag": 2103386241}, "raw_affiliation_strings": [], "institution_ids": [], "authors": [{"id": "https://openalex.org/A5002427750", "display_name": "Peter Zilla", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9502-4109", "position": "first", "is_corresponding": false}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/A5011669553", "display_name": "Roland Fasol", "orcid": null, "position": "middle", "is_corresponding": false}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/A5060512033", "display_name": "Manfred Deutsch", "orcid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5928-8737", "position": "middle", "is_corresponding": false}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/A5046702688", "display_name": "T Fischlein", "orcid": null, "position": "middle", "is_corresponding": false}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/A5025568825", "display_name": "Erich Minar", "orcid": null, "position": "middle", "is_corresponding": false}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/A5014355876", "display_name": "A.

A flexible, 2.8 mm diameter angioscope was introduced into the vessel for confirmation and accurate localization of the diagnosed embolus. A Fogarty embolectomy balloon catheter was passed alongside the angioscope and balloon inflation was visually calibrated to the exact vessel lumen. Thromboembolic debris was then retrieved under direct visualization. Intraoperative angiograms were obtained in all cases and results were compared with the finding at angioscopy. After conventional thrombectomy, angioscopic inspection revealed residual thrombus within the lumen or adherent to the wall in 10 of 12 cases. Residual debris was also identified in tributary vessels in two cases, and the embolectomy catheter was successfully guided into these channels by the tip of the scope. Limb salvage was achieved in all but one patient, with early follow-up of up to 18 months. As a result of this experience we conclude that angioscopic thromboembolectomy has several advantages over the traditional blind technique: (1) accurate detection and localization of thrombus or embolus; (2) monitoring and control of the degree of balloon inflation, thereby preventing vessel wall damage caused by overinflation; (3) detection and retrieval of residual clot after blind embolectomy; (4) manipulation of the balloon catheter to selected vessels; (5) decreased requirement for repeated arteriograms; (6) increased speed, convenience, and accuracy when compared with intraoperative angiography; and (7) avoidance of surgical exposure of the distal popliteal and tibial vessels.", "ids": {"openalex": "https://openalex.org/W2075808891", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1067/mva.1988.avs0070318", "pmid": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2963147", "mag": 2075808891}, "raw_affiliation_strings": [], "institution_ids": [], "authors": [{"id": "https://openalex.org/A5046854196", "display_name": "Geoffrey H.
