The surface area of jugular veins in humans is much smaller than in dogs and considerably longer grafts are needed. Moreover, the reproductive capacity of adult human endothelial cells under in vivo conditions, which probably determines the success of seeding more than the seeding density, is also uncertain. Therefore the efficiency of autologous endothelial seeding in humans was investigated in 18 patients undergoing distal femoropopliteal bypass surgery. The average surface area of the jugular veins was 4.9 +/- 1.7 cm2 with an average cell yield of 32.6 +/- 18.0 x 10(4). The mean number of seeded cells per square centimeter of graft surface was 3.1 x 10(3). In a follow-up extending for 14 weeks, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin as well as the platelet function in the whole blood aggregometer showed significantly better results in the seeded group. Plasma thromboxane B2, uptake and survival of indium 111-labeled platelets, and Doppler ultrasound investigations also favored the seeded group, but the results were statistically insignificant. No difference at all was found for the platelet dense granule compounds, releasable adenosine triphosphate and platelet serotonin. Thus our findings did not indicate the development of a closed endothelialized surface after 14 weeks, which is a period three times as long as the one required for confluent endothelial cell coverage in dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",2103386241,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3320387,,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2103386241,"['https://openalex.org/A5002427750' 'https://openalex.org/A5011669553'

The translation showed good acceptability, internal consistency and convergent validity in both samples. There were large and statistically significant differences between clinical and non‐clinical datasets on all scores. The reliable change criteria were similar to those for the UK referential data. Some of the clinically significant change criteria, particularly for the men, were moderately different from the UK cutting points. The Italian version of the CORE‐OM showed respectable psychometric parameters. However, it seemed plausible that non‐clinical and clinical distributions of self‐report scores on psychopathology and functioning measures may differ by language and culture. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: • A good quality Italian translation of the CORE‐OM, and hence the GP‐CORE, CORE‐10 and CORE‐5 measures also, is now available for use by practitioners and anyone surveying or exploring general psychological state. The measures can be obtained from CORE‐IMS or yourself and practitioners are encouraged to share anonymised data so that goodclinical and non‐clinical referential databases can be established for Italy.",2114236357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22438100,,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2114236357,"['https://openalex.org/A5028380903' 'https://openalex.org/A5084662083'

A flexible, 2.8 mm diameter angioscope was introduced into the vessel for confirmation and accurate localization of the diagnosed embolus. A Fogarty embolectomy balloon catheter was passed alongside the angioscope and balloon inflation was visually calibrated to the exact vessel lumen. Thromboembolic debris was then retrieved under direct visualization. Intraoperative angiograms were obtained in all cases and results were compared with the finding at angioscopy. After conventional thrombectomy, angioscopic inspection revealed residual thrombus within the lumen or adherent to the wall in 10 of 12 cases. Residual debris was also identified in tributary vessels in two cases, and the embolectomy catheter was successfully guided into these channels by the tip of the scope. Limb salvage was achieved in all but one patient, with early follow-up of up to 18 months. As a result of this experience we conclude that angioscopic thromboembolectomy has several advantages over the traditional blind technique: (1) accurate detection and localization of thrombus or embolus; (2) monitoring and control of the degree of balloon inflation, thereby preventing vessel wall damage caused by overinflation; (3) detection and retrieval of residual clot after blind embolectomy; (4) manipulation of the balloon catheter to selected vessels; (5) decreased requirement for repeated arteriograms; (6) increased speed, convenience, and accuracy when compared with intraoperative angiography; and (7) avoidance of surgical exposure of the distal popliteal and tibial vessels.",2075808891,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2963147,,,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2075808891,"['https://openalex.org/A5046854196' 'https://openalex.org/A5032745475'

The purpose of this study is to conduct a state-of-the-art review of interventions aimed at preventing and managing aggression in individuals with ID/ASD in formal care settings.
A systematic literature search was conducted on January 24th, 2024, focusing on three main concepts: “intellectual disabilities/autism spectrum disorders,” “aggressive behaviour” and “specialized services.” Four reference databases were searched. Two independent reviewers selected studies and conducted data extraction. References were categorized by major themes, with data extraction and narrative synthesis performed for each theme.
This paper found that the number of publications on this theme has gradually diminished over the past 30 years. The number of publications on psychosocial interventions increased, while those pertaining to pharmacological approaches decreased. In the former, studies on staff training have increasingly supplanted interventions directly targeting individuals with ID/ASD. Small, uncontrolled studies reported some efficacy for aggression management interventions, while controlled trials generally found no significant effects. Several authors emphasized the primary role of environmental factors in controlling aggression among individuals with ID/ASD.
The selection of literature in a unique pool without creating a separate search equation for each subsection of the study. It may cause the omission of important publications in the field. It does not allow for a complete picture of evaluated interventions for the prevention and management of violent behaviors in individuals with IA/ASD. However, it allows us to trace the evolution of discussions on the topic. In addition, a formal evaluation of the methodological quality of the included studies was not conducted.
This review may inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of matters in clinical intervention for aggressive behavior in adults with ID/ASD.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review taking a historical perspective in analyzing the development of approaches for dealing with aggressive behavior in adults with ID/ASD in formal settings. This perspective enables considering past unproductive paths and inspires the development of new approaches.",,,,,,[],"['新人 新人' 'Ashley J. Lemieux' 'Evelyne Robert-Berger'
